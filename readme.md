## 说明

本项目为浙江大学2025年秋《人工智能算法与系统》期末大作业，包含：

- 金融异常检测
- $MobileNetV2$-垃圾分类
- 中医辨证系统实现

$Mo$​平台可重复测试无穷次，测试时间会随平台当前使用人数、上传数据大小、网络波动等因素而浮动，测试分数也是如此，完全相同的代码得到的测试分数会存在一定程度的波动。但注意平台**仅允许提交一次**，所以请在检查报告与评分无误且满意后，再做提交。

如果你的目标仅仅是通过这三个作业，你可以在各项目做备份后，将本项目对应文件夹中的所有文件拖拽到Mo平台上实现覆盖，之后依次运行`main.ipynb`下的所有代码，确认无误后在左侧【提交结果处】进行测试并等待结果。待测试结果得到结果后，上传你的程序报告（推荐pdf形式，命名为”程序报告“就好）并点击提交，这样就完成了一个作业。如此往复，直到三个作业均提交完成。

因为目标是能在$Mo$平台上跑通而非完美完成任务，所以三个作业的评分离满分还有一定距离，你可以在此基础上进行迭代和优化。各作业文件夹下都附上了使用ChatGPT做的程序报告，可作参考。

## Explanation

This project is the final assignment for "Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Systems" at Zhejiang University in the autumn of 2025, which includes:

- Financial anomaly detection

- $MobileNetV2$- Garbage Classification

- Implementation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Differentiation System

The Mo platform can be tested infinitely multiple times, and the testing time will fluctuate depending on factors such as the current number of users, the size of data transmission, and network fluctuations. The same applies to test scores, which may fluctuate to some extent when obtained from identical code. However, please note that the platform **only allows one submission**, so please ensure that the inspection report and rating are correct and satisfactory before submitting.

If your goal is only to complete these three tasks, you can overwrite all files in the corresponding folder of each project by dragging them to the Mo platform after making backups. Then, run all the code under 'main.ipynb' one by one, confirm that it is correct, and test it in the 'Submit Results' section on the left and wait for the results. After obtaining the test results, upload your program report (recommended in the form of $pdf$, named "**程序报告**") and click submit to complete a task. Repeat this process until all three tasks are submitted.

Because the goal is to run smoothly on the Mo platform rather than completing tasks perfectly, there is still a certain distance from the full score for the three assignments. You can iterate and optimize on this basis. The program reports using ChatGPT are attached to each homework folder for reference.
